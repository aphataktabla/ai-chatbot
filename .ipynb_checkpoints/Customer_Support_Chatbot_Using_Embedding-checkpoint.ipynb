      "1.0 Introduction –  Manas Microsystems primary flow sensor (SROAT 1000 Plus) and smart flow transmitter(SS-1002) work on the principle of Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The meter is a true volume measuring meter. The measurement is independent of viscosity, density, dissolved / un-dissolved solids, pressure or temperature of the of the flowing liquid as long as it maintains minimum media conductivity of 20 Siemens. Various types of liner and electrode materials are available as per application requirements. The new sensors are more compact in size and more sensitive. Earth ring or earth electrodes both option are available. Empty tube detection feature is also incorporated in the new SROAT 1000 Plus flow sensors and is supported by SS-1002 smart flow transmitters. The Smart SROAT  SS-1002 flow transmitter also measures forward as well as reverse flow. The Smart SROAT (SS-1002) flow transmitter also works with SROAT 1000 primary flow sensors. The SROAT 1000 plus Flow sensor also works with SROAT 1000 A flow transmitter with or without empty tube detection.\n",

      "3.0 Description of different Programming modes in the Smart SROAT Flow  Transmitter  There are eight different modes in the SS-1002 Flow transmitter.  Note - Also, refer Section 5 and 7. 1.   RUN mode,  2.   RESET mode (RST)  3.   CONFIGURATION mode (CNFG) 4.  CALIBRATION mode (CAL) 5.   CHECK mode (CHK) 6.   COMMUNICATION mode (COMM)[Optional] 7.  DISPLAY mode (DISP) 8. TEST mode(TEST) NOTE – All the user configurable modes in the transmitter are PASSWORD protected to avoid programming / tampering of the settings by an UNAUTORIZED person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 7:\n",
      "3.1  RUN MODE The SS-1002 has a 16 characters x 2 rows LCD display with backlit for parameter indication and user interaction. In the RUN mode the 1st row indicates the instantaneous flow rate along with its engineering unit and the 2nd row indicates the total flow along with its set engineering unit. The total flow will not be displayed if not applicable. The transmitter measures forward as well as reverse flow. The user can configure the transmitter to show the effective total on the display in RUN mode or to display only the forward total (Refer Section 6 and Section 9 of this Instruction manual).\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 8:\n",
      "3.2  RESET MODE ( RST) This mode is to used to reset the total forward and reverse flow. Entering the correct password for this mode will reset the total flow. Incorrect password entry will not reset the total count.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 9:\n",
      "3.3  CONFIGURATION MODE ( CNFG ) CAUTION  - This mode is to be altered only by an AUTHORIZED person. All the meter configuration data like the meter size, engineering unit for instantaneous flow rate and total flow, full scale flow rate, decimal point position for total flow, full scale count rate, pulse width and full scale pulse rate can be entered in this mode. The resolution for the instantaneous flow rate is internally selected on the basis of meter size and the engineering unit configured. The SS-1002 flow transmitter supports flow rates corresponding to full scale velocity of 10 m/s max. Table 1.0 shows the resolution provided for different meter sizes as per the engineering unit selected for flow rate and the flow rates at 10 m/s for different line sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 10:\n",
      "TABLE 1.0 – Table for resolution provided in the SS-1002 transmitter with respect to the meter size and the engineering unit, configured for instantaneous flow rate and the maximum possible flow rate that can be entered in the configuration mode. Note  - The resolution for meter sizes above DN 150 up to DN 350 with the engineering unit selected as LPM will have a resolution of  x 10 LPM (multiplied by 10 resolution). For e.g. say that the full scale flow required is 30000 LPM for meter size DN 300, then the user has to configure the flow unit as LPM & flow span as 3000. The unit will automatically set the x 10 resolution & while displaying the flow rate the SS-1002 will display 3000 x10LPM flow rate. This resolution is set internally for the entire range of that meter size. Similarly, for all Engineering units of flow rate the resolution is internally set as per the above table. The maximum count rate supported by the SS-1002 flow transmitter is 18lacs. The maximum pulse rate that can be programmed in the SS-1002 flow transmitter depends on the pulse width programmed and is given by the relation given below:  Max. Pulse rate =  3600 2 * Pulse Width (in seconds). Under flow rate overflow conditions the pulse output may not be correct. Correctness of the pulse output is ensured in the configured range. If the flow rate exceeds the set full scale (Flow Span) entered in the CONFIG mode, increase the Flow Span in the CONFIG mode and modify or scale the Pulse Width and Pulse Rate accordingly to get correct pulse output. \n",
      "Note - If the flow tube is empty then the output will be clamped to 4mA and there will be no totalisation and no pulse output.  Also, you can configure SS-1002 transmitter to display Effective total (= Forward total – Reverse total) (i.e. to decrement total if reverse flow) if there is reverse flow or to show only the forward total flow in RUN mode.  Additionally, mass flow units like TPH & KGPH are also supported in SS1002. If you select any one of the mass flow units in CFG mode the unit will prompt for specific gravity of the fluid. The user has to enter the correct specific gravity of the fluid under measurement. Once the specific gravity is fed the SS1002 will automatically calculate the max flow limits as per the following relation. Max. allowed Flow span [TPH]= maxflow span allowed for m3/hr * specific gravity. Max. allowed Flow span [KGPH]= maxflow span allowed for m3/hr * specific gravity * 1000 Note :- Refer  TABLE 1 above for max. flow span allowed for m3/hr Resolution for TPH or KGPH is decided as below: The max. allowed value should be 4 digits. If the max. allowed flow span for TPH or KGPH is greater than zero & less than 10 then the resolution is 0.001, if it is greater than or equal to 10 & less than 100 then the resolution is 00.01, if it is greater than or equal to 100 & less than 1000 then the resolution is 000.1, if it is greater than or equal to 1000 & less than 10000 then the resolution is 0001, if it is greater than or equal to 10000 & less than 100000 then the resolution is 0001 x 10, if it is greater than or equal to 100000 & less than 1000000 then the resolution is 0001 x 100, if it is greater than or equal to 1000000 & less than 10000000 then the resolution is 0001 x 1000 For example:-  if in CFG mode you feed DN size = DN200, Unit for Flow Rate as KGPH & specific gravity entered is 1.236, then  Max. allowed flow span = 1131 * 1.236*1000 = 1397916,  Hence, the max. allowed span in SS1002 (KGPH) is 1397 & the resolution is x1000KGPH.\n",

      "Section 11:\n",
      "3.4  CALIBRATION MODE There is a slight difference in the ADC counts for zero flow depending on the installation of the flow meter, the grounding techniques used, etc. This is compensated by registering the correct zero flow counts in this mode. This mode is normally required to be used only once during commissioning of the flow meter. Install the flow meter correctly, fully fill the flow tube with the fluid under measurement, apply specified power to the SS-1002 transmitter at proper terminals (Note – the terminal details are pasted on the inside of the cover and are visible on opening the cover and viewing the cover from back side). Provide a warm up time of about 15 to 20 minutes and then set the zero flow counts using this mode. Note – This mode is to be altered by an AUTHORISED PERSON only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 12:\n",
      "3.5 CHECK MODE  This mode is useful for checking the calibration of the counter for fixed flow rate. This mode requires the use of Manas make Flow Simulator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 13:\n",
      "3.6 COMMUNICATION MODE  The PC communication parameters such as the baud rate, parity, Modbus device ID are to be set using this mode. Note: - RS485 port (2 wire) is a default port & RS232 port is provided on request if demanded at the time of P.O. Refer section 13 for MODBUS RTU protocol details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 14:\n",
      "3.7 DISPLAY MODE  This mode is not password protected. In this mode the total forward flow, the total reverse flow, the meter constant and the full scale velocity setting corresponding to the full scale flow span entered in the CNFG mode is indicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 15:\n",
      "3.8 TEST MODE This mode is useful for testing all the outputs available in the SS1002 flow transmitter. In this mode the user can adjust the flow rate irrespective of the actual flow using the increment key & decrement key(Note that the increment key functions as decrement key if LOCK LED is ON) & the instrument will deliver the outputs proportional to the adjusted flow rate. The data entered in CONFIG mode like Pulse rate, pulse width, count rate, decimal point position for count rate, full scale flow rate, engineering units for flow rate & counter is valid for test mode. The maximum limit of flow rate that can be set in this mode is equal to full scale flow, set in the configuration mode & minimum limit is zero. To speed up the increment operation, if you keep pressed the Increment key then the units place digit of the test flow rate will increment one by one by 9 counts then the tens place digit will start incrementing up to 90 then the hundreds place digit will increase up to 900 and so on. Decrement operation is also similar to the increment operation. The display for this mode is similar to that in the RUN mode, with ‘T’ indicating test mode written on the left side of flow rate display.  Shift key can be used in this mode to reset the total flow & check totaliser. Enter key is used to terminate this mode & return to RUN mode.  Note –  1. This mode has no timeout facility. Do not forget to come outside this mode once your testing is completed. You can press Enter key to come out of this mode. Once in TEST mode all background calculations as per actual flow are seized and all outputs are proportional to the test Flow rate set by user.  2. PC communication is not supported in this mode. 3. Reverse flow indication & totalization is not supported in this mode.  4. On entering this mode the flow rate & total flow is zero. User can set the desired test flow rate using Increment key. 5. Empty tube is not applicable for this mode.\n",

      "6.0  INSTALLATION AND COMMISSIONING (Before installation nd commissioning of the flow meter please read the DOs and DONTs section (6.1) carefully.    6.1 DOs and DONTs 1.   The mains power to the SS-1002 transmitter is 85 to 265 V ac, Single Phase, 50Hz or 24Vdc(Refer Nameplate). Ensure that the power supply provided is stable, noise free and within the specified tolerance. 2.   Do not loop the same power supply for the transmitter, which is used to drive high inductive switching loads like motors, pumps, solenoids etc. In such cases connect the mains supply directly from the source. 3. Ensure good earthing to the transmitter. The supply voltage between the Neutral and Earth should not be more than 4 V ac. 4.  The transmitter requires separate Live, separate Neutral and separate Earth terminals. Do not use short circuited Neutral and Earth. 5. Do not use square wave or quasi square wave UPS to power the Flow Meters. Use only sinusoidal output UPS to power the SMART SROAT SS-1002 Flow transmitters. 6. If there are fluctuations in supply voltage use of CVT is recommended. 7. Do not disturb any trimpot inside the amplifier / transmitter. This will disturb the calibration of the amplifier. 8.  The terminals provided on the bottom PCB are detachable (MALE / FEMALE) type connectors (i.e. the terminals numbered 1 to 10 are detachable connectors). This helps the engineer while commissioning the SS-1002 transmitter. 9.  Length and cross section of the Power Supply Cable - Upto 50 meters, 3 x 1.5 mm2 cable is sufficient for mains supply. For longer distances the cross section required is more, please consult factory.  10. Always ensure proper earthing to Primary flow tube ( Measuring Earth ), and also to amplifier / transmitter ( Protection Earth ). Earth resistance should be < 10 . 11. The earthing of the primary flow tube must be separate from normal electrical   “ earth grid ” used in the plant. 12. In case of remote amplifier / transmitter if flow indicated on the display is negative interchange the wires from Pin 8 and Pin 9 of TS2 connector inside the head mounted Terminal Box on Flow Tube. NOTE  Before Installation and Commissioning of the Flow Meter please read the \n",
      "DOs and DONTs section ( 6.1 ) carefully.         \n",
      "       13. In case of remote transmitter do not install the amplifier/ transmitter exposed to direct sunlight or at a place subjected to intense vibrations. Install the transmitter at a place where no vibrations are present. 14. While installing the Flow Meter Tube ( Integral or Remote Transmitter ) make sure that no vibrations are present at the location of installation. 15. In case of remote transmitter, while connecting the shielded cables do not ignore shield connections. The cables should be as far away as possible from any power cables or switch gear cables [ min. distance between signal cables and power cables should be greater than 12 inches. ] 16. Use proper snubber circuits across the coils of the switchgear assemblies near to the transmitter. 17. The installation of the primary flow tube and transmitter should be as away as possible from heavy electrical loads.      18. Verify the polarity of the load connected across the output. 19. Ensure the load connected across the output terminals is within specifications. 20. Ensure that the transmitter mounting screws and the lid screws for the transmitter and the head mounted terminal box on the flow tube ( if remote transmitter ) are always tightened properly to maintain the IP67 class protection. 21. Do not expose the amplifier / transmitter ( Integral / Remote ) to direct impact of sun and rain. 22. Ensure that no vibrations are present at the location of installation of Flow tube and transmitter. 23. Ensure that the cable glands are sealed ( tightened ) properly to maintain the IP67 Class protection. 24. Ensure that there are no leakages on the inlet side or outlet of the installed flow meter. Due to leakages on the inlet side of the Flow Tube air gets mixed with the fluid under measurement and causes measurement errors. The Electromagnetic Flow meter does not measure Bi-Phase flow. 25. Do not loop or cross cables inside the transmitter enclosure. 26. If Empty Tube Indication is not required, connect a wire link between terminal numbers 16 & 19 inside the transmitter.  Ensure that the strands of the wire link connected does not touch with any other wire or terminal other than 16 & 19. Please note that if Empty tube indication is bypassed as given above display may show erratic readings under empty tube condition.    \n",

The direction of flow through the pipe is the same as indicated on the primary flow tube by a red arrow.   II. Straight lengths of 5D on upstream  and 3D on downstream, measured from the Electrode axis is maintained.   If disturbances like cork screwing or  vortex flow conditions are present straight lengths should be increased or flow straightners should be used. Flaps, slidegates, valves etc  should be arranged at a distance of at least 3D  down stream of primary flow tube.    III.  Ensure that  primary flow tube  remains completely filled by the fluid under measurement   even under no flow condition. This  ensures  trouble  free  and  reliable operation of the  Flow meter.  Select a location on the pipe,  which will  always run  full of liquid.  For  vertical  installations the direction of flow against  gravity ensures full pipe. Some of the recommended installations are as under -                   a) Recommended    b) Not Recommended  c) Recommended             Flow  NRV  Flow  Red arrow  \n",

This ensures full pipe under      no flow condition.      e) Locations 1 and 2 are recommended locations,      Location 3 is the highest point in pipe run      this location is not recommended since air     bubbles collect in the metering tube which      will lead to faulty measurements.     Location 4 is also not recommended since     at zero flow the line will get drained and     hence will give false measurements.             f) In case of heavily contaminated    fluids, the primary flow tube    should be installed with a    bypass pipeline and isolation     valves so that it can be    removed for cleaning without     interrupting operation.    1.

Strong Electromagnetic fields should not be located in the immediate vicinity of the flow tube since these could affect the field generated by the coils in flow tube and hence disturb the reading stability and accuracy. Ensure that no magnetic material other than the pipe and connecting flanges should come in contact with the flow tube.  V.

      "        IX   Grounding  Efficient grounding of Primary Flow Tube is absolutely essential for accurate measurements. In an Electromagnetic flow metering system the fluid acts as an electric conductor. The ground connection must ensure that the measurement is not falsified by any additionally injected signal. The ground conductor should not add any noise and interference signal. In short other electrical / electronic machines, appliances, instruments should not be connected to the same conductor or to the same earth pit. The ground resistance must be less than 10 Ohms. The measuring ground simultaneously acts as protecting ground also, but it should not be connected to the protection Earth terminal in the amplifier (Power Terminals). \n",

The above message will stop flashing if the flow rate comes within 1% of configured flow rate above full scale flow rate. For example if the configured flow rate is say 6.00 m3/hr then the “FLOW RATE OVFL” message will start flashing if the flow rate exceeds 6.60m3/hr and will stop flashing when the flow rate falls below 6.06m3/hr.  If the message does not stop flashing, it means that the FLOW SPAN in the configuration mode has to be increased. 2. If the count rate exceeds 105 counts per hour then the SS-1002 will flash a message “COUNT RATE OVERFLOW” on the 2nd Row of the LCD display. The count rate and the open collector pulse rate are clamped at maximum 105 counts or pulses per hour. 3.
